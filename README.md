# CUDA Blelloch Scan

Work-efficient implmentation of Blelloch scan for finding prefix sum with parallelized multi-threaded algorithm in $O(\log{N})$ steps.

Simple, easy-to-understand implementation for the blog. Feel free to add additional functionality for vectors of non-2-exponent sizes, or try to implement the Mamba scanning algorithm (replacing addition operations with associative matrix multiplications).
